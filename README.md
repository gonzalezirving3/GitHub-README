Hi, I'm Irving Gonzalez

I'm interested in learning how to make websites.

I'm currently learning HTML, CSS & Javascript in the Front-End Career Path. Eventually I want to complete both Front-End and Back-End to become a full stack web developer.

The purpose of this GitHub account is to document the projects I work on as part of my lessons from [Codecademy.com](https://codecademy.com).
